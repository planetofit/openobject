# Zelda

Zelda is a 3 or more dimesional object which carries x,y and plains all the time in a single call. Though the position of the plains could be different at the time of the call, by a fraction of a time is negotiated for server heavy calls and by grabbing 3 or more vars using a single object same time gives zelda and ability to grab an another time unit and pass the delta of time and vars.

# Applications

Zelda is most useful for transforming data between two sources, which are radioley operating in a different region.

In IT, zelda can capture and rotate calls data between, router and switches, active and passive ports, bios and os, applications to ci/cd() and cycle continues.

More applications will be in feild of IoT sensors and smart devices.


# I tested zelda using the scripts in this folder. Some env setup I did before was:
- Install VS Code
- Install Anaconda
- Create a new env in Anaconda
- Activate the new env
- Install require plugins
- (optional, if you are making a json file of your packages) pip install -r requirements.txt
- test various scripts and feel free to update them for others to understand zelda and its calculations
